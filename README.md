# Ubunye-Orchestration-ML

This repository contains code for MEC service orchestration, utilizing resource allocation algorithms to optimize Quality of Experience (QoE) and Quality of Service (QoS) in edge computing environments. This guide provides instructions for setting up the environment and running the provided code.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.12.6 or later is installed.
- **Dependencies**: The necessary libraries are described in a `requirements.txt` file for automated installation.

## Installation

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (optional)

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. Use `venv` or `conda` as preferred.

#### Using venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
or
python -m venv myenv

source myenv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
myenv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### 2. Install the necessary dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Code

After configuring the environment, run the script to start the orchestration simulation.
